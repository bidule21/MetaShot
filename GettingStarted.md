## Hardware/Software Requirements
MetaShot is written for Android 8.0 (API level 26) with the minimum support of Android 7.0 (API level 24).

In order to utilize the "automatic recording of shots" functionality in the app, a MetaWear device is necessary. When purchasing a MetaWear device, ensure it contains, at minimum, the following sensors:
* Accelerometer 
* Temperature

MetaWear devices can be purchased from https://mbientlab.com/store/.

NOTE:
* Android protects users from inadvertent download and install of unknown apps, or apps from sources other than Google Play, which is trusted. Android blocks such installs until the user opts into allowing the installation of apps from other sources. The opt-in process depends on the version of Android running on the device:
* On devices running Android 8.0 (API level 26) and higher, you must navigate to the Install unknown apps system settings screen to enable app installations from a particular location.
* On devices running Android 7.1.1 (API level 25) and lower, users should enable the Unknown sources system setting, found in Settings > Security on the devices.
* When you attempt to install an unknown app on a device running Android 7.1.1 (API level 25) or lower, the system sometimes shows a dialog that asks whether you want to allow only one particular unknown app to be installed. In almost all cases, you should allow only one unknown app installation at a time if the option is available to you.
Note: Some network providers donâ€™t allow users to install applications from unknown sources.

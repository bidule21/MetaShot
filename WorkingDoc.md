Technical Review
=======
Native android or Hybrid?

* Hybrid would use ember, might be easier
* Android would use Java, might give us better control, lab exercise to work off of.

Do we want to support ads?

Do we want to mine data?
* Would require a Django API service

Where are we going to store user data?
* Do we store on device?
* - Not sure how difficult
* - Probably use sqllite, tutorial found
* Store data on web
* - Would require a Django API service 
* - Would use ajax call, similar to the ad server attack lab. 
* - Would make mining data easy
* - Would tie user to be connected to the internet.
* - Require account information

What Android APIâ€™s will we use
* GPS
* Weather API
* BlueTooth

What third party tool will we be using
* Chart view

What Meta Wear features will we use
* Accelerometer + Gyroscope
* Pressure (Barometer) ???
* Temperature??? Barrel temperature

Future Features If we have time
========
Facebook integration

Twitter integration

Instagram integration

Ability to take a picture of the target and save it to the shooting record

Based on ML data, suggest if bad aim was due to shaky movement of a shot

Hunting mode
* Allows for users to GPS location shot and hit
* Provide hunting related information such as sun rise and set times

Web Page interface (might be possible if we store all data, and do a hybrid app)

Allow users to view there shooting/shot records online.
* Would require us to store all data and credential management.
